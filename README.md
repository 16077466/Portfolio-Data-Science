* By my own mistake I had been learning Python through the datascience server with the inpro assignments. Therefore I do not have datacamp course completed.

# 2 Reflection and evaluation
## 2.1 Reflection on own contribution to the project
* Situation: At the end of the project I had a hard time dealing with the way the project had gone thus far. Apart from me liking to work with project team, certain ways we handled the project did not sit right with me and can be put on me as well as the rest. For example there was a lot of research done on former studies about Building management system time series data imputation and different imputation methods known to work well for time series data. But in the end this literature did not get taken seriously and everyone did their own work without having research to back it up. This led to problems later on and became apparent during the writing on the research paper. 
* Task: My task I had in this context was literature researcher and writing the research paper together with my project collogue Julien. Here we had to collect all the data and results from the imputation methods used and tested by our other group members and to make the research valid we had to link the methods and results to former literature/research. Since everything was done without the backed-up research before hand, this caused for a lot of extra work going through dozens of researches and eventually taking two whole weeks to validate all research done.
* Action: How I handled this situation was by extensively going through my researches found earlier in the project and going online finding new valid research. There was no time and point staying stuck in the fact that the methods were not handled correct by the project members and me so I did what I had to do at that given time and that was put a lot of overwork in to make sure the research paper had all the research it needed.  
* Result: In the end the extra work and over hours that were put in the research paper paid off very well. The research paper got finished on time and with sufficient and valid research to back up our findings and methods used during this project.
* Reflection: The main thing I learned from this situation is that I could have been more assertive at the beginning of the project and said to my team “Listen, I am the one who does the literature research for former research done on this topic and field. It is okay if you do your own research too but make sure to note the research you found or want to use and link it to me for later use.” This would have saved all the extra work and trouble I had to go through.
